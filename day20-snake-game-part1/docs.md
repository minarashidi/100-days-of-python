# Snake Game on Nokia 3310

Creating a classic Snake game can be broken down into the following seven key steps:

## 1. Create a Snake Body
Create a snake body; three squares on the screen all lined up next to each other.

## 2. Move the Snake Continuously 
The snake should move forward continuously. 

## 3. Control the Snake Using Keyboard Keys
Allow the player to control the snake's direction using the arrow keys: up, left, down, and right.

## 4. Detect Collision with Food
Place food items randomly on the screen. When the snake collides with the food, it should "eat" the food, and a new piece should appear in a different location.

## 5. Create a Scoreboard
Implement a scoreboard to keep track of the score, incrementing each time the snake eats a piece of food.

## 6. Detect Collision with Walls
End the game with a "Game Over" message if the snake collides with the wall.

## 7. Detect Collision with Tail
Similarly, the game should end if the snake's head collides with any part of its own body.
