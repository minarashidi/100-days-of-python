# Instructions

Given a dictionary `student_scores` containing student names as keys and their exam scores as values, write a program to convert the scores to grades. The program should create a new dictionary `student_grades` where student names are keys and grades are values.

This is the grading criteria:

- Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
- Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
- Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
- Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

## Expected Output

{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Mina': 'Outstanding', 'Tony': 'Acceptable', 'Sara': 'Fail'}
