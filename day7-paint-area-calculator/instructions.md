# Instructions

You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can say that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

Number of cans = (wall height x wall width) / coverage per can.

For example, if:
Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

Number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.


## Example Input
3
9
## Example Output
You'll need 6 cans of paint.
